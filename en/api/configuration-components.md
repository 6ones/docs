> Nuxt.js 2.13+ can scan and auto import your components.

- Type: `Boolean` or `Object`
 - Default: `false`

When set to `true` or using an object, it will include the `@nuxt/components` dependencies and auto import your components (defined in `~/components`) when you use them in your templates.

ℹ️ Please refer to [nuxt/components](https://github.com/nuxt/components) repository for usage and options.
